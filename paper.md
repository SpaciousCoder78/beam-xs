# Statement of need

The beam-xs library addresses a critical need in the field of civil engineering by providing an accessible and efficient tool for the analysis of simply supported beams. Traditional methods of beam analysis can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex loading conditions and beam configurations. This Python library simplifies the process by offering a user-friendly interface and robust computational capabilities, enabling engineers and students to perform accurate structural analysis quickly and effectively.

The need for such a tool is underscored by the increasing demand for reliable structural analysis in both academic and professional settings. Engineering students require practical tools to complement their theoretical knowledge, while professionals need efficient solutions to streamline their workflow and ensure the structural integrity of their designs. By automating the calculations and providing detailed results, beam-xs enhances productivity and reduces the likelihood of human error.

Furthermore, the library's open-source nature encourages collaboration and continuous improvement from the engineering community. Users can contribute to its development, share insights, and help expand its functionality to cover more complex scenarios and advanced analysis techniques. This collaborative approach ensures that beam-xs remains a cutting-edge tool that evolves with the needs of its users, making it an indispensable resource for structural beam analysis.
